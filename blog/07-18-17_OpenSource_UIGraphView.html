                        <h3>UIGraphView</h3>
                        <p>I recently wrote a custom view class for iOS. I wanted to display information in my apps in a chart view. Since there wasn't anything native for me to use, I looked around at the current open source options and nothing really jumped out at me as having a good balance of "this does what I want" and "this is simple and easy to setup." I wanted something that would be easy for me to plug-and-play into my current apps as well as future projects I might find it useful for. So after debating with myself for a while on whether I was up to the task, I slowly started putting things together myself, learning different aspect of Core Graphics along the way. I'm glad I did because I feel like I learned a good amount and, while I'm certain my code isn't perfect, I'm proud of myself for managing to put something together that does what I was hoping for.</p>
                        <p>So, long story short, I managed to throw together some code based on some examples I had seen, some structure I had learned from other things I had tried to use, and the things I learned along the way. To my astonishment, it worked. Then I started to thing, "hey, it's pretty cool that I managed to do this, but I wonder if someone else could use or (better yet) improve on this?" So after some more debating, a bit of reading on where to even begin, and a lot of refactoring and cleaning up, I decided to throw the code up on GitHub for anyone to use and maybe even help me improve!</p>

                        <h3>Open Source!</h3>
                        <p>This is the first time I've made an open source project. This is actually the first time I've even contributed to an open source project. So really, I might not be doing everything right, but I'm trying. I'm hoping that by doing this maybe someone else will find my code useful as well. Maybe I'll even get into a couple good conversations or have someone suggest ways I can improve it. I'm definitely open to all of this! I'd love to hear from anyone who uses the code in one of their projects. If you let me know, I might even throw a link to your project up the ReadMe for this one. Also, to anyone who does have any suggestions, please feel free to let me know! <a href="https://twitter.com/pmostoff">You can contact me on Twitter if you'd like!</a></p>
