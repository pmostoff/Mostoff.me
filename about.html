                        <h3>The Introduction</h3>
                        <p>My name is Peter Mostoff. I enjoy long walks on the beach and clean typography. In my spare time I like to enjoy the outdoors and occasionally I dabble in photography. I make it my goal to find the beauty in things that get overlooked and enjoy life as much as I can. I like to create things. I hope to share some of that with the world and hope to make some stuff that I can take pride in along the way.</p>
                    </div>

                        <h3>The Goal</h3>
                        <p>Ultimately, I'd like to make things that help make other people's lives at least a little bit better. The first step in my mind is to make things that I'd actually want to use myself. That's the first bit of thinking that goes into any of my projects. Would I actually use this? Do I really think this would be helpful? The ideas that pass those questions will hopefully become real things in the world.</p>

                        <h3>The Rest of the Story</h3>
                        <p>For as long as I can remember I've been trying to figure out what I want to do with my life. No matter what idea I came up with along the way, one deeply profound theme always remained: I like cool things. In all seriousness though, I've always had the desire to create things. I want to make things that will change people's lives, even if only for a moment, for the better.

                        <br>
                        We live in an amazing time for enthusiasts of both art and technology as we’ve created a new cycle. Technology pushes the types of art that we are capable of creating and art pushes the types of technology we can make. A greater importance is now being placed on not only the functionality of a device or a website or a service, but also on the design. It isn't enough to just work anymore. People care about the type of experience that they get out of using something or viewing it. Art has a lot to do with the style of something but it doesn't just stop there. There's art in the way that we interact with things. There's art and design in the experience and I'd like to try to make a good one.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        I've always thought to myself, no matter what my overall goal was going to be, that if something that I had created could make at least one person smile, or one person think “I'm glad this exists" that my work would be worth it. We're only here for so long and I want to leave my mark where I can. So that's what my goal ended up being: I want to make things that people will enjoy when they see them, and enjoy how they interact with them.</p>
